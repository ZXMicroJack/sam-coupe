MGT SAM Coupe
=============

Based on McLeod's SAM coupe core.  Added single disk drive reading from SDcard in either
FAT16 or FAT32 format in DSK format.  Also a PS2 mouse should be working - it works fine
on another board, but I don't have a splitter to test the ZXUNO yet.

Keys
----
- F12 - disk menu
- F5 - NMI button
- CTRL-ALT-DEL - reset SAM
- CTRL-ALT-Backspace - reset to BIOS.
- SCROLL-LOCK - switch from VGA to RGB and back.
- (numeric keypad [-]) - switch on/off scanlines

Known issues
------------
- Only 1 disk at the moment
- Only support for .DSK format
